2.2. GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------
Cannoneer works on the principal that, at the bottom left hand corner of the screen, there is a cannon, and the user must fire this cannon and attempt to hit the target in each level. Once the target is hit, the next level will begin. There are ten levels, and the player will be timed according to how long he/she takes to finish all ten levels. The time the player takes will be his/her score.

To fire the cannonball, the player must click on the screen depending on how he wants to direct the ball: clicking further away from the cannon will increase the velocity of the cannonball, and the mouse position also determines the angle at which the cannonball is fired. The cannonball also experiences a force of gravity, so it is possible to lob the cannonball over obstacles. It is important to note that only ONE cannonball can be fired at a time.

There are three types of obstacles in Cannoneer. Blue obstacles are solid, and if the cannonball hits one, the cannonball will explode, but the obstacle will remain in its position. Green obstacles are breakable, so the player can fire at them to break them. Purple obstacles are solid, but move back and forth between two places at varying speeds.

The target must be hit by a cannonball to progress to the next level, and the user must determine a way to make it past the obstacles to hit the target. Each level should only have ONE target.

When all ten levels are complete, your score will be recorded and others can compete against you. Remember that the lowest score is the best score!

Now go have fun!
